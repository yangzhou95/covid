      "text/plain": "'Same symptoms here! Also asthmatic. I’m finishing up my second week and down to still no sense of smell, ear/sinus pressure that seems to be slowlyyy getting better, fatigue, and some minor lingering chest tightness/shortness of breath that’s controlled by my inhaler. I also had the weird carb cravings!! though without smell, I’ve kind of lost my appetite now.Yes! I am eating rice right now because my stomach is generally unsettled as well. It’s the only thing that seems to be helping.Pressure headache, increased burping, difficulty swallowing, burning in noseYes!! I normally take Claritin daily for allergies and haven’t needed it the entire time I had COVID (or even really now that I’m recovered). I also had similar symptoms to you - my ear pressure was killer at points and I had dizziness, migraine, loss of smell. I’m recovered, but still relying on my inhaler a bit.NYC small apartment person here. Unfortunately, I tried to isolate when my boyfriend started getting sick but it was impossible due to the apartment size/single bathroom and I got sick too.Mine started coming back after 8 days of no smell. Definitely a gradual process.I have asthma and have recently recovered from COVID. I’m still dealing with breathing issues/relying on my inhaler a bit more than normal. I will say that it feels similar to when I was recovering from pneumonia a few years ago - I remember it took a solid month after I had recovered to truly be able to resume normal physical activity without needing my inhaler/getting slightly winded.For what it’s worth, I started my period during week 2 of my covid experience. Provided week 2 seems to be the rough week for many, but I definitely noticed my symptoms took a turn for the worse on the day I started my period.Yeah. I am a little over a month from initial symptoms and around a week & a half into being recovered (as in no new symptoms and the symptoms my dr said were just lingering are just about clear). I seem to be able to handle a gentle, short walk okay but I pushed myself with the cardio yesterday and almost fainted. Spent the night & morning with breathing issues, mild chest pain, & lightheadedness but it seems to be resolving now almost 24 hours later. I do have very mild asthma but prior to COVID, I barely ever needed my inhaler.  It feels very similar to my experience having pneumonia in the past. It took me a solid month after the pneumonia resolved for my lungs to be back to normal.I did up until about a week ago. That seems to have mostly resolved now (a little over a month since the start of symptoms) but I did have a slight issue a couple days ago after having video calls the entire work day.My breathing symptoms reared their ugly head around day 12 and stuck around until the end. I wasn’t really improving around day 21 & I ended up on a round of antibiotics for “potential” mild pneumonia (my dr didn’t have me come in the office for a chest X-ray due to my symptoms still being mild and the healthcare here being overloaded) and I honestly believe that took me over the recovered finish line.I’m officially at week 5 today. I think I was battling the actual virus for about 2.5 weeks but ended up going into the dr’s at 4.5 weeks for blood work/checking vitals due to still having some lingering symptoms. I do have a stubborn secondary sinus/ear infection now & am on antibiotics. Generally speaking - labs/vitals are good and I am honestly feeling much better than I did a few weeks ago (even with a couple minor setbacks and some lingering symptoms that may be due to the secondary infection). Dr said people are having the low grade fever, chest pains for weeks after battling the virus. I do notice symptoms increase if I exert myself.My energy level went back to almost normal around day 21 or so, however if I exert myself too much then I do get minor “relapses”. I’ve been off the inhaler for around a week and my vitals/blood work are now all normal as of day 33 (and my chest is clear!). Day 37 now and dealing with a stubborn secondary sinus infection and lingering blurred vision that will hopefully resolve when the sinuses resolve. I do still go up to 99 degrees temperature-wise but my dr said they are seeing this with many lingering mild cases (along with the intermittent chest pain).I lost my sense of smell completely for 8 days and then it started gradually coming back. It’s close to fully back now and I’m around 3ish weeks from the day I lost it.8 days of complete loss of smell. Very gradual return and I’m about 90% back 3-4 weeks from initial loss of smell.I’ve also noticed a sensitivity to caffeine and I’m a former multiple cups a day coffee drinker. Do you mind elaborating on the sensitivity? I swear my heart rate spikes/I feel weird with just a sip now.1. I felt recovered from the active part of the virus after about 2.5-3 weeks. Though I still was a little (mildly) up & down during week 4. I’m 5 weeks from initial symptoms now. 2. I think I’m recovered from the virus itself but I am on antibiotics for a secondary sinus infection so I’m not feeling 100%. My vision is a little blurrier than before I had the virus. Unsure if this will clear up or is permanent. My sense of smell is probably 90% back & again, unsure if this is what it is now. Like another comment, I’ve noticed a lingering sensitivity to caffeine. I can handle walks fine but when I try to do stronger cardio, I feel it for a day or two after. Very slow progress though! 3. Yes. I have mild asthma and had to rely on my inhaler for weeks 2-4. I no longer need it. I do still get the occasional rapid heart beat and chest tightness/dull pain but it’s gotten better this week. My dr said my chest was clear as of a week ago. 4. I could’ve been more active but I’m not overweight and am in generally good health. I did walk a considerable amount daily out of necessity given I live in a major city.Wanted to follow up here. I can now handle black tea without crazy heart rate spikes. This is from not being able to have a sip of anything caffeinated a few weeks ago. Thinking this might end up being an annoying but short term issue. Fingers crossed!For the record, I’m still not 100% at around 7 weeks (heart rate is a bit all over the place, lingering dizziness/lightheadedness, blood pressure fluctuations - most of this is triggered by too much activity). My blood work is back to normal at this point. My Dr said it’s likely post viral syndrome and it’s just going to take time for my body to get back on track. I’m in NYC and she said she has quite a few mild/moderate cases exhibiting the same lingering symptoms.I asked my Dr during the appointment and she said according to the most recent guidance she’s been given, likely no longer contagious. However, she did say to take precautions as if I was (wearing a mask/social distancing) as they are getting new information all the time. She also said if I tested positive at this point, it’s probably just dead virus particles.  The short of it - probably not but nobody really knows for sure.Dizziness was my first symptom and I’m still getting it at 7 weeks, though I’m pretty sure it’s post viral now.No real treatment. I have meclizine for the dizzy spells but otherwise I was told that my body is recovering so make sure it gets the nutrients it needs (and up my protein because my muscles are weaker now), hydrate/electrolytes, and try to start doing some light exercise. I have weekly check ins (video or via message if I’m feeling good) with my Dr so she can monitor. It should resolve over time and in all honesty, it has been very slowly getting better. On my bad days, I’m now more often having a few bad hours instead of being down for the count for days. I can handle walking for a couple miles without crashing the next day now as well.Yes, meclizine for the dizziness. To be fair, I was already on it for vertigo so I’ve always had a prescription.My allergies definitely kicked in once I was in recovery after an absence of symptoms while actively dealing with covid. Week 7 here and my allergies are back in full force as of about 1.5-2 weeks ago.Sinus/ear issues (and dizziness) were probably my worst and longest lasting symptoms of covid. I did two rounds of antibiotics and the last round seems to have gotten it, but Dr thinks I might still be dealing with some ear inflammation because I’m still not 100% with them. I’m still on prescription Flonase. Hands down worst sinus issues of my life. And now my allergies are back... :(I’m not a Dr & I guess I honestly can’t fully confirm if the sinus/ear were due to covid, allergies, or just the overproduction of mucus from covid meeting my existing crappy sinus drainage that I’ve dealt with my whole life, ha. I did test positive for covid (and am positive for IgG antibodies now) and it all hit at the same time so it was lumped in with treating the rest of my symptoms. I also had total loss of sense of smell after an intense sinus burning episode about a week into covid symptoms.Both of my ears had bad pressure & crackling and I ended up having a double ear infection that needed antibiotics. See my comment above for a more detailed explanation of if it was covid related or not - basically it occurred with my confirmed covid case but I suppose it could’ve been something happening alongside it as well. Not sure, but it was awful nonetheless and started when my covid symptoms started.Haha I was happy when mine seemed to return but now I’m annoyed with them again. :) I was on a round of z-pak & then a longer course of augmentin.It did work for me but I am thinking that’s because my sinus/ear infections were secondary bacterial infections after the viral infection. It did take until the last couple days for it to work (I was on a 14 day course). I do still have lingering sinus/ear issues but I’m pretty sure they are allergy related. I also took fluticasone prescription nasal spray the whole time and I think that helped as well.My temp was definitely lower than normal when I was battling covid. It actually raised at the tail end of it (around 3 weeks) to 99. It’s back to normal now at 7 weeks.Yep! Diagnosed with post viral syndrome by my primary care doctor. EKG & blood work normal. Saw a cardiologist and he confirmed it was likely post viral syndrome but is still having me wear a special heart monitor for a week to rule out anything else.   For the record, both my Dr & the cardiologist recommended light exercise. I know this can be triggered by overdoing it, but I’m on week 7.5 now and daily light exercise (like a gentle walk or some light yoga) has started helping me. My resting heart rate is finally back in the normal range most days but I am still going a bit higher than normal when I move around at all. I do occasionally have high resting heart rate days but they are less & less now and I’ve noticed they seem to be triggered when I either take my allergy meds or I’m stressed out. My body’s reaction to stress seems to be enhanced.I have asthma (and allergies). I’ve recovered now (with the exception of post viral syndrome symptoms that I’ve posted about in other threads). I didn’t feel like having asthma was overly detrimental with my case. I did rely on my rescue inhaler daily at the height of it (prob for a span of 2 weeks) and I use my rescue inhaler now more frequently than I have in years. However, I found it overall manageable with the inhaler. In fact, I think having asthma & being prone to pneumonia/bronchitis over the years really helped my anxiety from getting out of hand because I know what it feels like to have issues breathing and I know when it’s serious enough to need to be treated with something other than my inhaler.   I did have a longer case of covid (my non-asthma partner fought the virus in a week compared to my 3-4 weeks of actively fighting the virus) but unsure if that was related to the asthma. I did not get pneumonia to my knowledge, though I couldn’t get a chest X-ray because my symptoms didn’t warrant it.  I should note that despite having asthma, I’m generally active. I was a runner prior to getting COVID, though I had slacked a little in the months leading up to getting it. Not sure if that was helpful in keeping the asthma under control.This is also about where I am at around 8 weeks, except I’m still getting lightheadedness from time to time.It’s worth it to check with your doctor. I saw my primary dr and a cardiologist about the same thing. Both think it’s due to post viral syndrome - basically my immune system is still reacting even though I’ve beaten the virus and there’s some lingering autonomic dysfunction as my body rights itself. I’m also getting random bouts of lightheadedness/dizziness. I will say that both recommended light exercise so I’ve been doing gentle walks daily. Yesterday & today I’m finally seeing my heart rate stabilizing a bit, even while walking. I’m coming up on 8 weeks since initial symptoms tomorrow.I’m finally taking vitamins regularly and staying hydrated. I slacked so bad with my health & eating habits before getting COVID and being hyper aware of my body during a longer term case has really turned that around. I’ve started going for daily walks at the recommendation of my dr to help with recovery and I can’t remember when I last made a point to go on a daily walk! I KNOW I’ll come out of this experience healthier than I’ve been over the last year.   Also like others have mentioned, being stuck in a tiny apartment with my boyfriend has deepened our relationship and made me 100% sure that he’s the right person for me!Yeah, my symptoms were mainly neurological and I also had major sinus issues. Tested positive and my antibody test was positive so I definitely had it. My first symptom was a really bad dizzy spell and I lost my sense of smell. I did have about a week of respiratory symptoms but it wasn’t the star of the show.No tinnitus, but definitely ear pain and fullness along with dizzy spells. Ended up with a secondary ear infection that needed antibiotics.I had a viral bronchitis in February. Got COVID in March. Mild lung symptoms during COVID - my lung symptoms during bronchitis were worse. This was actually surprising to me because I have asthma. However, I got stuck with a lingering case of COVID.Yes!! I’m down to mild SOB that seems to be tied to acid reflux. I am asthmatic normally but I never had reflux like this before COVID. I’m also 2 months in. I thought I was going nuts. Definitely going to speak with my doctor about it tomorrow. Thank you for posting!Same here! And I echo this post. My very mild, well controlled asthma turned into somewhat moderate asthma after COVID and I’m on a daily steroid inhaler now.I think I was fighting the virus for like 3 weeks but had lingering issues for over 8 weeks. If it’s helpful, I tested positive for IgG antibodies around week 5. I am mostly fine now but dealing with my comorbidities flaring up, basically. I have asthma & GERD.My CBC was normal at around 3 weeks but my ALT was slightly elevated and my d-dimer was a weak positive. At 7 weeks, both my ALT & d-dimer (along with everything else) were back to normal.Me! Finally! My resting is back where it should be (I’m at 9 weeks today). I’m still going a little higher than normal when I do any activity but my walking heart rate is in the high 90s/low 100s now after previously spiking as high as 160s.   Both my dr & cardiologist recommended light exercise and daily walks have really helped my heart & my lungs improve.9 weeks since first symptoms (I never had a fever). My heart rate started returning to normal this week.I had been diagnosed with GERD maybe 15 years ago but a month on a PPI took care of it and I never had it (or thought about it) again. Until COVID. After 8 weeks, my dr finally advised me to take Nexium for 2 weeks and I have to say, so many of my lingering chest symptoms have resolved. I’m down to just getting my existing asthma under control now (which is happening finally - wondering if the acid reflux was triggering it).Yes. I’m now 9 weeks from first symptoms and recovered. Vision is still blurrier than normal but it’s not declining anymore. I want to wait a few months before updating my glasses prescription but I’m starting to think this might be here to stay.Redhead here. 40 & female. Confirmed COVID in March. I’ve posted about my symptoms a bunch here so feel free to look at my post history. All in, I was sick for about 8 weeks total. About 3 weeks fighting the virus & about 5 weeks post viral syndrome. I’m fully recovered now at almost 10 weeks.'"

Dr said people are having the low grade fever, chest pains for weeks after battling the virus. I do notice symptoms increase if I exert myself.',\n",
    "  'My energy level went back to almost normal around day 21 or so, however if I exert myself too much then I do get minor “relapses”. I’ve been off the inhaler for around a week and my vitals/blood work are now all normal as of day 33 (and my chest is clear!). Day 37 now and dealing with a stubborn secondary sinus infection and lingering blurred vision that will hopefully resolve when the sinuses resolve. I do still go up to 99 degrees temperature-wise but my dr said they are seeing this with many lingering mild cases (along with the intermittent chest pain).',\n",
    "  'I lost my sense of smell completely for 8 days and then it started gradually coming back. It’s close to fully back now and I’m around 3ish weeks from the day I lost it.',\n",
    "  '8 days of complete loss of smell. Very gradual return and I’m about 90% back 3-4 weeks from initial loss of smell.',\n",
    "  'I’ve also noticed a sensitivity to caffeine and I’m a former multiple cups a day coffee drinker. Do you mind elaborating on the sensitivity? I swear my heart rate spikes/I feel weird with just a sip now.',\n",
    "  '1. I felt recovered from the active part of the virus after about 2.5-3 weeks. Though I still was a little (mildly) up & down during week 4. I’m 5 weeks from initial symptoms now. 2. I think I’m recovered from the virus itself but I am on antibiotics for a secondary sinus infection so I’m not feeling 100%. My vision is a little blurrier than before I had the virus. Unsure if this will clear up or is permanent. My sense of smell is probably 90% back & again, unsure if this is what it is now. Like another comment, I’ve noticed a lingering sensitivity to caffeine. I can handle walks fine but when I try to do stronger cardio, I feel it for a day or two after. Very slow progress though! 3. Yes. I have mild asthma and had to rely on my inhaler for weeks 2-4. I no longer need it. I do still get the occasional rapid heart beat and chest tightness/dull pain but it’s gotten better this week. My dr said my chest was clear as of a week ago. 4. I could’ve been more active but I’m not overweight and am in generally good health. I did walk a considerable amount daily out of necessity given I live in a major city.',\n",
    "  'Wanted to follow up here. I can now handle black tea without crazy heart rate spikes. This is from not being able to have a sip of anything caffeinated a few weeks ago. Thinking this might end up being an annoying but short term issue. Fingers crossed!',\n",
    "  'For the record, I’m still not 100% at around 7 weeks (heart rate is a bit all over the place, lingering dizziness/lightheadedness, blood pressure fluctuations - most of this is triggered by too much activity). My blood work is back to normal at this point. My Dr said it’s likely post viral syndrome and it’s just going to take time for my body to get back on track. I’m in NYC and she said she has quite a few mild/moderate cases exhibiting the same lingering symptoms.',\n",
    "  'I asked my Dr during the appointment and she said according to the most recent guidance she’s been given, likely no longer contagious. However, she did say to take precautions as if I was (wearing a mask/social distancing) as they are getting new information all the time. She also said if I tested positive at this point, it’s probably just dead virus particles.  The short of it - probably not but nobody really knows for sure.',\n",
    "  'Dizziness was my first symptom and I’m still getting it at 7 weeks, though I’m pretty sure it’s post viral now.',\n",
    "  'No real treatment. I have meclizine for the dizzy spells but otherwise I was told that my body is recovering so make sure it gets the nutrients it needs (and up my protein because my muscles are weaker now), hydrate/electrolytes, and try to start doing some light exercise. I have weekly check ins (video or via message if I’m feeling good) with my Dr so she can monitor. It should resolve over time and in all honesty, it has been very slowly getting better. On my bad days, I’m now more often having a few bad hours instead of being down for the count for days. I can handle walking for a couple miles without crashing the next day now as well.',\n",
    "  'Yes, meclizine for the dizziness. To be fair, I was already on it for vertigo so I’ve always had a prescription.',\n",
    "  'My allergies definitely kicked in once I was in recovery after an absence of symptoms while actively dealing with covid. Week 7 here and my allergies are back in full force as of about 1.5-2 weeks ago.',\n",
    "  'Sinus/ear issues (and dizziness) were probably my worst and longest lasting symptoms of covid. I did two rounds of antibiotics and the last round seems to have gotten it, but Dr thinks I might still be dealing with some ear inflammation because I’m still not 100% with them. I’m still on prescription Flonase. Hands down worst sinus issues of my life. And now my allergies are back... :(',\n",
    "  'I’m not a Dr & I guess I honestly can’t fully confirm if the sinus/ear were due to covid, allergies, or just the overproduction of mucus from covid meeting my existing crappy sinus drainage that I’ve dealt with my whole life, ha. I did test positive for covid (and am positive for IgG antibodies now) and it all hit at the same time so it was lumped in with treating the rest of my symptoms. I also had total loss of sense of smell after an intense sinus burning episode about a week into covid symptoms.',\n",
    "  'Both of my ears had bad pressure & crackling and I ended up having a double ear infection that needed antibiotics. See my comment above for a more detailed explanation of if it was covid related or not - basically it occurred with my confirmed covid case but I suppose it could’ve been something happening alongside it as well. Not sure, but it was awful nonetheless and started when my covid symptoms started.',\n",
    "  'Haha I was happy when mine seemed to return but now I’m annoyed with them again. :) I was on a round of z-pak & then a longer course of augmentin.',\n",
    "  'It did work for me but I am thinking that’s because my sinus/ear infections were secondary bacterial infections after the viral infection. It did take until the last couple days for it to work (I was on a 14 day course). I do still have lingering sinus/ear issues but I’m pretty sure they are allergy related. I also took fluticasone prescription nasal spray the whole time and I think that helped as well.',\n",
    "  'My temp was definitely lower than normal when I was battling covid. It actually raised at the tail end of it (around 3 weeks) to 99. It’s back to normal now at 7 weeks.',\n",
    "  'Yep! Diagnosed with post viral syndrome by my primary care doctor. EKG & blood work normal. Saw a cardiologist and he confirmed it was likely post viral syndrome but is still having me wear a special heart monitor for a week to rule out anything else.   For the record, both my Dr & the cardiologist recommended light exercise. I know this can be triggered by overdoing it, but I’m on week 7.5 now and daily light exercise (like a gentle walk or some light yoga) has started helping me. My resting heart rate is finally back in the normal range most days but I am still going a bit higher than normal when I move around at all. I do occasionally have high resting heart rate days but they are less & less now and I’ve noticed they seem to be triggered when I either take my allergy meds or I’m stressed out. My body’s reaction to stress seems to be enhanced.',\n",
    "  'I have asthma (and allergies). I’ve recovered now (with the exception of post viral syndrome symptoms that I’ve posted about in other threads). I didn’t feel like having asthma was overly detrimental with my case. I did rely on my rescue inhaler daily at the height of it (prob for a span of 2 weeks) and I use my rescue inhaler now more frequently than I have in years. However, I found it overall manageable with the inhaler. In fact, I think having asthma & being prone to pneumonia/bronchitis over the years really helped my anxiety from getting out of hand because I know what it feels like to have issues breathing and I know when it’s serious enough to need to be treated with something other than my inhaler.   I did have a longer case of covid (my non-asthma partner fought the virus in a week compared to my 3-4 weeks of actively fighting the virus) but unsure if that was related to the asthma. I did not get pneumonia to my knowledge, though I couldn’t get a chest X-ray because my symptoms didn’t warrant it.  I should note that despite having asthma, I’m generally active. I was a runner prior to getting COVID, though I had slacked a little in the months leading up to getting it. Not sure if that was helpful in keeping the asthma under control.',\n",
    "  'This is also about where I am at around 8 weeks, except I’m still getting lightheadedness from time to time.',\n",
    "  'It’s worth it to check with your doctor. I saw my primary dr and a cardiologist about the same thing. Both think it’s due to post viral syndrome - basically my immune system is still reacting even though I’ve beaten the virus and there’s some lingering autonomic dysfunction as my body rights itself. I’m also getting random bouts of lightheadedness/dizziness. I will say that both recommended light exercise so I’ve been doing gentle walks daily. Yesterday & today I’m finally seeing my heart rate stabilizing a bit, even while walking. I’m coming up on 8 weeks since initial symptoms tomorrow.',\n",
    "  'I’m finally taking vitamins regularly and staying hydrated. I slacked so bad with my health & eating habits before getting COVID and being hyper aware of my body during a longer term case has really turned that around. I’ve started going for daily walks at the recommendation of my dr to help with recovery and I can’t remember when I last made a point to go on a daily walk! I KNOW I’ll come out of this experience healthier than I’ve been over the last year.   Also like others have mentioned, being stuck in a tiny apartment with my boyfriend has deepened our relationship and made me 100% sure that he’s the right person for me!',\n",
    "  'Yeah, my symptoms were mainly neurological and I also had major sinus issues. Tested positive and my antibody test was positive so I definitely had it. My first symptom was a really bad dizzy spell and I lost my sense of smell. I did have about a week of respiratory symptoms but it wasn’t the star of the show.',\n",
    "  'No tinnitus, but definitely ear pain and fullness along with dizzy spells. Ended up with a secondary ear infection that needed antibiotics.',\n",
    "  'I had a viral bronchitis in February. Got COVID in March. Mild lung symptoms during COVID - my lung symptoms during bronchitis were worse. This was actually surprising to me because I have asthma. However, I got stuck with a lingering case of COVID.',\n",
    "  'Yes!! I’m down to mild SOB that seems to be tied to acid reflux. I am asthmatic normally but I never had reflux like this before COVID. I’m also 2 months in. I thought I was going nuts. Definitely going to speak with my doctor about it tomorrow. Thank you for posting!',\n",
    "  'Same here! And I echo this post. My very mild, well controlled asthma turned into somewhat moderate asthma after COVID and I’m on a daily steroid inhaler now.',\n",
    "  'I think I was fighting the virus for like 3 weeks but had lingering issues for over 8 weeks. If it’s helpful, I tested positive for IgG antibodies around week 5. I am mostly fine now but dealing with my comorbidities flaring up, basically. I have asthma & GERD.',\n",
    "  'My CBC was normal at around 3 weeks but my ALT was slightly elevated and my d-dimer was a weak positive. At 7 weeks, both my ALT & d-dimer (along with everything else) were back to normal.',\n",
    "  'Me! Finally! My resting is back where it should be (I’m at 9 weeks today). I’m still going a little higher than normal when I do any activity but my walking heart rate is in the high 90s/low 100s now after previously spiking as high as 160s.   Both my dr & cardiologist recommended light exercise and daily walks have really helped my heart & my lungs improve.',\n",
    "  '9 weeks since first symptoms (I never had a fever). My heart rate started returning to normal this week.',\n",
    "  'I had been diagnosed with GERD maybe 15 years ago but a month on a PPI took care of it and I never had it (or thought about it) again. Until COVID. After 8 weeks, my dr finally advised me to take Nexium for 2 weeks and I have to say, so many of my lingering chest symptoms have resolved. I’m down to just getting my existing asthma under control now (which is happening finally - wondering if the acid reflux was triggering it).',\n",
    "  'Yes. I’m now 9 weeks from first symptoms and recovered. Vision is still blurrier than normal but it’s not declining anymore. I want to wait a few months before updating my glasses prescription but I’m starting to think this might be here to stay.',\n",
    "  'Redhead here. 40 & female. Confirmed COVID in March. I’ve posted about my symptoms a bunch here so feel free to look at my post history. All in, I was sick for about 8 weeks total. About 3 weeks fighting the virus & about 5 weeks post viral syndrome. I’m fully recovered now at almost 10 weeks.']\n",
